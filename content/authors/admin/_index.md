    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I received the bachelor degree in Engineering Mechanics from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China in 2018. I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, [Missouri University of  Science and Technology](https://www.mst.edu/) under the co-supervision of [Dr. Donald C. Wunsch II](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=fQC7bIoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Dr. Tie Luo](https://tluocs.github.io/). My research interests include computer vision, bioinformatics, medical image processing and adversarial machine learning. More specifically, my focus lies in delving into modules that enhance the representation, optimization, generalization, and robustness of DNNs, drawing from both theoretical insights and empirical experimentation.
